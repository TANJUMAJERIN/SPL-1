# SPL-1
I'll upload my spl-1 project here. I am going to build up a malware detecting system.For this,
I have to implement two algorithms. One is a hashing algorithm named SHA-512 and the another is a string 
matching algorithm. First of all I find the hash value of known malware files and store them in a file.Then I
take a input text file and find it's hash value. After this, I will match the hash value with the malware hashes.
If, any matching found, then the file is malware affected and i will conduct a static analysing then.
